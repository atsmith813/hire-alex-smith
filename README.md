# [Hire Alex Smith](https://hirealexsmith.com "My personal website")
Here is my personal site, Hire Alex Smith! It serves 2 main purposes.
1. Tell people more about how I can help them.
2. With a name as generic as Alex Smith, I wanted something I could point
  everything back to (blog posts, forum posts, etc.) to help keep my personal
  branding more consistent.
