TLDR
</h3>
<p>
A borderline cold brew coffee addict and a Florida native currently
residing in Los Angeles, California, my name is Alexander Smith (Alex).
If I had to describe a
<em>"personal mission statement"</em>
, I'd say that mine is to provide others with opportunities -
especially if it helps them move up the so-called socio-economic
ladder.
</p>
<p>
While I call Tampa home, I was born in Baltimore, MD and I've
been to Germany more times than my fingers permit me to count. I have a
black belt in Taekwondo (it's been awhile though). I originally planned
to join the military and was in ROTC in High School. My friends call me
an adrenaline junkie because I love anything with an engine. I've had
experience with 4-wheelers, go-karts, boats, jet skis, motorcycles,
sports cars, and more. If it goes fast, I'm interested. Speaking of
interested, want to learn more?  You can read more about...

Where I've been
</h3>
<p class='about-me-quote'>
<i class='fa fa-quote-left fa-3x fa-pull-left'></i>
You don't know where you're going until you know where you've been.
</p>
<br>
<p class='about-me-text'>
<p>
From flipping burgers at the neighborhood DQ to Wall Street. I've been
working since I was 15 years old, and it all started at the local DQ
Grill & Chill. Looking back, it was a blast working with friends and
making my own money. After DQ, I worked at Papa John's, literally
"making dough".
</p>
<p>
Upon graduating high school, I moved from Tampa to Orlando to attend
the University of Central Florida on scholarship. I started as an Accounting
major. I was convinced that with my math skills, it was all but
decided for me. Then, I stumbled upon an organization called the Young
Investors Club where I was bit by the "stock market bug". I quickly
changed my major to Finance with a certificate in investments. Soon
after, I landed a paid internship at a local Scottrade branch (brokerage
firm) in my sophomore year. I was fully immersed in the finance world,
I was studying it, working in it, and loving it! For the summer of
my junior year, I took a leave of absence from Scottrade to move to
New York City for an internship with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. At
this point I was only confirming what I already knew: I wanted to live
and work on Wall Street. After that summer, the structured products
team offered me a full-time position. That senior year was a blast.
Once I had my degree in hand, I sold my soul, threw on a suit, and
caught the next flight to NYC to start my new life in the "real world".
</p>
<p id='baml'>
I was in the honeymoon phase and loving every second of it. My summer
internship had been a rotation program, so I had the opportunity to
experience many different teams, but now I was on the structured
products team full-time. What is a structured product? The one-liner
on the brochure might read something like,
</p>
<p>
<span style='font-style: italic;'>
"Structured products are made up of several equity, commodity,
FX, and interest rate derivatives packaged with senior unsecured
debt to provide investors alternative investment vehicles to help
them meet and exceed their financial goals.""
</span>
</p>
<p>
Right? What the heck does all that even mean? Here's how I typically
explain it. Lets take a more normal investment, such as buying 1
share of Apple Inc. (aapl). If you bought that share when Apple was at
$100, and then it goes up to $105, you as an investor made a 5%
return. Apple stock went up 5%, you made 5%. This is a
<span style='font-style: italic;'>
linear payoff.
</span>
The investment went up 5%, you made 5%. That payoff looks like this:
</p>
<p class='text-center'>
<img src="/images/linear_graph.png" id="linear_graph" class="graph" alt="Linear graph" />
</p>
<p>
Now, back to structured products. By doing some super complicated
and magical financial sorcery, we created products that turned that
linear payoff into something more exotic like this:
</p>
<p class='text-center'>
<img src="/images/arn_graph.png" id="arn_graph" class="graph" alt="Arn graph" />
</p>
<p>
or this:
</p>
<p class='text-center'>
<img src="/images/step_up_graph.png" id="step_up_graph" class="graph" alt="Step up graph" />
</p>
<p>
Now if Apple went up 5%, you could make 15%. Or if Apple was simply
up by any amount you could make at least 30% while having 10% downside
protection. Pretty cool, right?
</p>
<p>
<small style='font-style: italic;'>
These are hypothetical examples and do not reflect actual
products or investment advice.
</small>
</p>
<p>
So what did I do? I would model and price these products by analyzing
roughly 15 different input variables (read: buzzwords) such as the
delta, vega, and strike price to determine the present value of the
structured product, given the current stock market conditions at that
time (interest rates, trading volumes, etc.). See, I told you it was
magic.
</p>
<p>
So there I was, making more money than I realistically knew how to spend
wisely in one of the most highly sought after destinations in the world,
New York City. My parents were proud. My peers were envious. By most
definitions of where I'm from, I had more than made it.
</p>
<p>
But I hated it. I left.
</p>
<p>
I wish I could say that it was just that quick and easy, I didn't like
it so I left. But the truth is it took me a couple of years to muster
the strength to toss away everything I had worked so hard to get my
entire life. To start over. But really, it was a quite the journey to
that final decision. I remember, my last day of work was on a Thursday,
and the next day I was on a flight at 10:30 am back to Florida to take
some time off for a few months.
</p>
<p>
I then joined a fellowship called
<a href='https://ventureforamerica.org/' target='_blank'>Venture For America (VFA)</a>.
I encourage you to check them out, but the short of it is they're a
non-profit organization dedicated to the revitalization of the economy
by recruiting top talent to join startups outside the major hubs (i.e.
San Francisco, New York, etc.) in places such as Columbus, Pittsburgh,
and Philadelphia. By doing this, fellows gain invaluable experience
on what it takes to start a company. After the fellowship, VFA has
ample resources to help fellows start their own venture, and thereby
creating more jobs in the economy.
</p>
<p id='mentorcliq'>
This is what brought me to Columbus, Ohio. I spent a year doing my part to
give back by working with organizations dedicated to helping first-generation
students and students of underrepresented backgrounds get into college. By
leveraging technology and mentorship, we were able to help thousands of
students get into college who otherwise likely would have never gone. As a
first-generation college student myself, this was very fulfilling and I was
happy to feel like I was making a difference.
</p>
<p>
Over time, as I continued to work more with technology, I realized my
previous coding experience was something I was constantly gravitating
back towards, so I decided to upgrade it from a hobby to my sole focus.
</p>
<p>
I began coding with every minute of my spare time and teaching myself
new languages. To top it all off, I received a full scholarship to attended
a coding bootcamp,
<a href='https://www.techtalentsouth.com/' target='_blank'>Tech Talent South</a>,
to meet other people looking to change career paths and to take my
skills even further.
</p>
<p id='ticketfire'>
From there, I landed a gig at
<a href='https://ticketfire.com' target='_blank'>TicketFire</a>
where I was a Full-Stack Software Engineer working on some really cool things!
</p>
<p>
With TicketFire you can buy, sell, and digitize your event tickets. That
means you can take a picture from our mobile apps of that Columbus Crew
ticket you have (or should have, go Crew!), and text it to your friends.
</p>
<p>
From a technology perspective, it's even more exciting. Because we scanned
images for event information to turn into tickets, because at their core
tickets are a digital asset, and because we have a live exchange/marketplace
with 100,000+ events across 5,000+ venues around the world, I've been lucky
enough to work on some very challenging and rewarding projects. The
algorithms, 3rd party API integrations, and sheer size of the platform all
made it a lot of fun to work on. Being one of three developers, I was able to
take on a lot of responsibility and leadership very quickly. I was also very
fortunate to be able to work with two of the best developers and mentors that
Columbus (and beyond) has to offer,
<a href='https://lscott3.com/' target='_blank'>Larry Scott</a>
and
<a href='https://www.linkedin.com/in/dscotts3/' target='_blank'>Dwight Scott</a>.
</p>
<p>
Then life brought me to Cincinnati.

I've always wanted to get back to the finance world I left behind. Longing
for a new professional challenge to coincide with my move, I landed a new gig
as a Software Engineer at Intrinio, a fintech startup working to democratize
financial data, based out of my hometown, Tampa, Florida.
</p>
<p>
About 6 months later, some life events brought me back home to Tampa, Florida.
Go Lightning ⚡️.
</p>
<p>
Transitioning into big data, a M-A-S-S-I-V-E platform, and new technologies
has been a blast. At Intrinio we use several languages and frameworks
including, but certainly not limited to:
</p>
<p>
Frontend
<ul>
<li>Angular</li>
<li>CoffeeScript</li>
<li>CSS</li>
<li>HTML</li>
<li>JS</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
Backend
<ul>
<li>Elixir</li>
<li>Padrino</li>
<li>Phoenix</li>
<li>Ruby</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
We build APIs, Excel plugins, Google Sheets plugins, and more that make it easy for
enterprises, developers, funds, etc. to get the data and licensing they need.
We've become experts in the
<a href='http://blog.intrinio.com/intrinio-data-journey/' target='_blank'>Data Journey</a>
and it's exciting to contribute to such explosive growth here at Intrinio.
</p>
<p>
Currently, I'm working on long-term project that involves building several new
products around Cryptocurrencies. Did you know that Cat Coins are
<em>actually</em>
a thing? I certainly didn't.
</p>
<p>
A few highlights of what I've accomplished so far:
<ul>
<li>
Using a proprietary and custom built ETL platform, I wrote integrations
with 3rd parties to normalize millions of data points, daily.
</li>
<li>
Developed a real-time integration using Elixir and Phoenix to stream, on
average, ~10,000 messages per second including Cryptocurrency trades and
Cryptocurrency book updates for more than 1,000 Cryptocurrency pairs
across 20+ exchanges.
</li>
<li>
Implemented a new authetication method, Cryptocurrency real-time data
streams, and Forex real-time data streams in our SDKs using Java, C#,
Ruby, Python, and JavaScript.
</li>
<li>
Created a distributed computing setup with Elixir to more efficiently
stream thousands of stock prices per second to users at scale.
</li>
<li>
Developed several new data feeds for users such as Cryptocurrencies,
Forex prices, Municipality Financials, and more. The process of building
a data feed typically consists of integrating with 3rd parties to consume
the data, building the endpoints, documentation, unit tests, integration
tests, and updating SDKs.
</li>
<li>
Built a
<a href='https://github.com/intrinio/technical-analysis' target='_blank'>technical-analysis gem</a>
, an open-sourced Ruby library for performing technical analysis on stock prices and
other data sets.
</li>
<li>
Built API endpoints, search engine, and interface to search over 1,000,000
8-K filings from the SEC. For example, a user could search for something
like
<em>"((lawsuit OR fraud) AND Q4 NOT 2017)"</em>
and the endpoints would return all 8-Ks matching the specified logic
including text snippets where the matches were found.
</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p id='justice'>
One of my life goals is to open doors for others. Another way to think of this
is to provide more opportunities to others to better themselves.
In pursuit of this, I moved to LA and I've joined
<a href='https://irontreeca.com' target='_blank'>Iron Tree</a>.
With Iron Tree I cofounded and built
<a href='https://justice.irontreeca.com' target='blank'>Justice by Iron Tree</a>
which is a platform that helps to erase unjust cannabis records. Our
automated and simplified process saves victims weeks of stress and thousands
of dollars in legal fees.

They say,
<em>"life is what happens when you're busy making other plans".</em>
Life got in the way a little bit in the way this year. I was on vacation
when I had an accident on the Maderas Volcano on Ometepe Island in Nicaragua.
I snapped my collar bone and had to have surgery to put a 5-inch titanium
plate and 8 screws into my shoulder. This threw quite the wrench in my plans.

Hobbies and interests
</h3>
<p>
Hobbies and interests can be so vague...I like to think of this section
as answers to the question of, "what are some things that you would go
out of your way to do in your free time?". But that's not a cool title
so I still call these hobbies and interests.
