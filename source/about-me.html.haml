        TLDR
      %p.about-me-text
        A Florida native currently residing in Columbus, Ohio, my name is
        Alexander Smith (Alex). While I call Tampa, FL home, I was born in
        Baltimore, MD and I've been to Germany more times than my fingers
        permit me to count. I have a black belt in Taekwondo (it's been
        awhile though). I originally planned to join the military and was in
        ROTC in High School. I consider myself a mild adrenaline junkie and I
        love anything with an engine. I've had experience with 4-wheelers,
        go-karts, boats, jet skis, motorcycles, sports cars, and more. If it
        goes fast, I'm interested. Speaking of interested, want to learn more?

        Our DNA is 96% chimpanzee. Is that even worth arguing?! If I gave
        you a sandwich that was filled with 96% sh*t and 4% ham, would you
        be willing to consider that a ham sandwich? So If you ever start
        taking things too seriously, just remember that we are talking monkeys
        on an organic spaceship flying through the universe. - Joe Rogan
