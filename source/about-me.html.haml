        A Florida native currently residing in Columbus, Ohio, my name is
        Alexander Smith (Alex). While I call Tampa, FL home, I was born in
        Baltimore, MD and I've been to Germany more times than my fingers
        permit me to count. I have a black belt in Tae Kwon Do (it's been
        awhile though). I originally planned to join the military and was in
        ROTC in High School. I consider myself a mild adrenaline-junky and I
        love anything with an engine. I've had experience with 4-wheelers,
        go-karts, boats, jet skis, motorcycles, sports cars, and more. If it
        goes fast, I'm interested. Speaking of interested, want to learn more?

          From flipping burgers at the neighborhood DQ to Wall Street. I've been
          working since I was 15 years old, and it all started at the local DQ
          Grill & Chill. Looking back, it was a blast working with friends and
          making my own money. After DQ, I worked at Papa John's, literally
          "making dough".
        %p
          Upon graduating high school, I moved from Tampa to Orlando to attend
          the University of Central Florida on scholarship. I started as an Accounting
          major. I was convinced that with my math skills, it was all but
          decided for me. Then, I stumbled upon an organization called the Young
          Investors Club where I was bit by the "stock market bug". I quickly
          changed my major to Finance with a certificate in investments. Soon
          after, I landed a paid internship at a local Scottrade branch (brokerage
          firm) in my sophomore year. I was fully immersed in the finance world,
          I was studying it, working in it, and loving it! For the summer of
          my junior year, I took a leave of absence from Scottrade to move to
          New York City for an internship with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. At
          this point I was only confirming what I already knew: I wanted to live
          and work on Wall Street. After that summer, the structured products
          team offered me a full-time position. That senior year was a blast.
          Once I had my degree in hand, I sold my soul, threw on a suit, and
          caught the next flight to NYC to start my new life in the "real world".
        %p
          I was in the honeymoon phase and loving every second of it. My summer
          internship had been a rotation program, so I had the opportunity to
          experience many different teams, but now I was on the structured
          products team full-time. What is a structured product? The one-liner
          on the brochure might read something like,
        %p
          %span{ style: 'font-style: italic;' }
            "Structured products are made up of several equity, commodity,
            FX, and interest rate derivatives packaged with senior unsecured
            debt to provide investors alternative investment vehicles to help
            them meet and exceed their financial goals.""
        %p
          Right? What the heck does all that even mean? Here's how I typically
          explain it. Lets take a more normal investment, such as buying 1
          share of Apple Inc. (aapl). If you bought that share when Apple was at
          $100, and then it goes up to $105, you as an investor made a 5%
          return. Apple stock went up 5%, you made 5%. This is a
          %span{ style: 'font-style: italic;' }
            linear payoff.
          The investment went up 5%, you made 5%. That payoff looks like this:
        %p.text-center
          = partial 'partials/linear_graph'
        %p
          Now, back to structured products. By doing some super complicated
          and magical financial sorcery, we created products that turned that
          linear payoff into something more exotic like this:
        %p.text-center
          = partial 'partials/arn_graph'
        %p
          or this:
        %p.text-center
          = partial 'partials/step_up_graph'
        %p
          Now if Apple went up 5%, you could make 15%. Or if Apple was simply
          up by any amount after 1 year, you could make 30% for example. Pretty
          cool, right?
        %p
          %small{ style: 'font-style: italic;' }
            These are hypothetical examples and do not reflect actual
            products or investment advice.
        %p
          So what did I do? I would model and price these products by analyzing
          roughly 15 different input variables (read: buzzwords) such as the
          delta, vega, and strike price to determine the present value of the
          structured product, given the current stock market conditions at that
          time (interest rates, trading volumes, etc.). See, I told you it was
          magic.
        %p
          So there I was, making more money than I realistically knew how to spend 
          wisely in one of the most highly sought after destinations in the world,
          New York City. My parents were proud. My peers were envious. By most
          defintions of where I'm from, I had more than made it.
        %p
          But I hated it. I left.
        %p
          I wish I could say that it was just that quick and easy, I didn't like
          it so I left. But the truth is it took me a couple of years to muster
          the strength to toss away everything I had worked so hard to get my
          entire life. To start over. But really, it was a quite the journey to
          that final decision. I remember, my last day of work was on a Thursday,
          and the next day I was on a flight at 10:30am back to Florida to take
          some time off for a few months.
        %p
          I then joined a fellowship called
          = succeed '.' do
            %a{ href: 'https://ventureforamerica.org/', target: '_blank' } Venture For America (VFA)
          I encourage you to check them out, but the short of it is they're a
          non-profit organization dedicated to the revitalization of the economy
          by recruiting top talent to join startups outside the major hubs (i.e.
          San Francisco, New York, etc.) in places such as Columbus, Pittsburgh,
          and Philadelphia. By doing this, fellows gain invaluable experience
          on what it takes to start a company. After the fellowship, VFA has
          ample resources to help fellows start their own venture, and thereby
          creating more jobs in the economy.
        %p
          This is what brought me to Columbus, Ohio.

        Our DNA is 96% chimpanzee. Is that even worth arguing?! If I gave
        you a sandwich that was filled with 96% sh*t and 4% ham, would you
        be willing to consider that a ham sandwich? So If you ever start
        taking things too seriously, just remember that we are talking monkeys
        on an organic spaceship flying through the universe. - Joe Rogan

        Retired corporate mercenary turned Full-Stack Developer at
        = succeed '.' do
          %a{ href: 'https://ticketfire.com', target: '_blank' } TicketFire
        After moving to Columbus, I spent a year doing my part to give back by
        working with organizations dedicated to helping first-generation students
        and students of underrepresented backgrounds get into college. By
        leveraging technology and mentorship, we were able to help thousands of
        students get into college who otherwise liekly would have never gone.
        As a first-generation college student myself, this was very fulfilling
        and I was happy to feel like I was making a difference.
      %p
        Over time, as I continued to work more with technology, I realized my
        previous coding experience was something I was constantly gravitating
        back towards, so I decided to turn it into something more full-time.
      %p
        I began coding with every minute of my spare time and teaching myself
        new languages. To top it all off, I attended a coding bootcamp,
        %a{ href: 'https://www.techtalentsouth.com/', target: '_blank' } Tech Talent South
        to meet other people looking to change career paths, and to take my
        skills even further.
      %p
        From there, I landed into my current gig, where I am a Full-Stack
        Software Engineer at
        %a{ href: 'https://ticketfire.com', target: '_blank' } TicketFire
        where we are doing some really cool things!
      %p
        With TicketFire you can buy, sell, and digitize your event tickets. That
        means you can take a picture from our mobile apps of that event ticket
        you have, and text it to your friends.
      %p
        From a technology perspective, it's even more exciting. Because we scan
        images for event information to turn into tickets, because at their core
        tickets are a digital asset, and because we have a live exchange/marketplace
        with 100,000+ events across 5,000+ venues around the world, I've
        been lucky enough to work on some very challenging and rewarding projects.
        The algorithms, 3rd party API integrations, and sheer size of the platform
        all make it a lot of fun to work on. Being one of three developers, I've
        been able to take on a lot of responsibility and leadership very quickly.
        I'm also very fortunate to be able to work with two of the best developers
        and mentors that Columbus (and beyond) has to offer,
