              I build custom API integrations to enhance your existing technology
              with 3rd party services. My tools of choice include Ruby on Rails,
              Javascript, HTML, CSS, SQL, and more!

              updates and formatting, and more time focusing on your business.

              I'll build you models to answer those tough "what if" questions
              about the future. I can even include the information formatted
              in your presentations and have it update itself automatically.

              down for you. Looking to break into Software Development? I can
              teach how you to get started. Confused about how much a
              contractor is charging you to build your MVP? I can offer a
              second opinion.

        .question
          What does a typical project engagement look like?
        %p
          While there's no typical project, engagements begin with a 20 minute
          discovery call where we can discuss the project, scope, and timeline.
          For teaching, speaking, or consulting engagements we will schedule
          1-hour blocks accordingly.
