            “Our DNA is 96% chimpanzee. Is that even worth
            arguing?! If I gave you a sandwich that was filled with 96% sh*t
            and 4% ham, would you be willing to consider that a ham sandwich?

            that we are talking monkeys on an organic spaceship flying
            through the universe.” - Joe Rogan
