                Automatically import data from websites or other files, generate
                reports, and perform those pesky reptitive tasks so you can spend
                less time in spreadsheets fighting against updates and formatting,
                and more time focusing on your business. Don't budget an entire
                salary for a new hire, automate your entire process with a single
                click!

                I'll build you models to answer those tough "what if" questions
                about the future. I can even include the information formatted
                in your presentations and have it update itself automatically.

                down for you. Looking to break into Software Development? I can
                teach how you to get started. Confused about a contractor is
                charging you to build your MVP? I can offer a second opinion.
